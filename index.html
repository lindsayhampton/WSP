    <h1>Hey there,</h1>
    <p>My name is Lindsay Hampton and I'm pretty much the coolest thing since sliced bread. I'm a full-time WDD student at Full Sail University as well as a Tour Guide at the Behind the Scenes tours held here each month. I love animals, chinese food, and I'm always pretty happy. Let's be friends.</p>

            <h3>The Navigation Bar:</h3>
            <p>This is the website Navigation Bar. A nav bar is used to help the user navigate which section of the website they would like to visit. Rather than spending several minutes searching for the part of the website that the user is looking for, the navigation bar helps to organize the website and make the user experience much more pleasant.</p><br>
            <p>On this particular website, the navigation bar is the very first thing that the user will see as the page loads. This allows the user to understand what options the website has in store for their viewing pleasure. The hover feature is also clearly used on this particular page, allowing users to visualize which link they are about to click on and assuring that they are going to the correct place.</p>
            <h3>How to Build This:</h3>
            <p>A navigation bar similar to this one would be built mainly through unordered lists within the nav element, though a div element may also be used. This particular nav bar seems to be within a container div as well, and has a border underneath to separate the nav bar from the header.</p>
            <h3>How I Would Style This:</h3>
            <p>If I were stylizing this nav bar, I would start with an unordered list featuring list items of a tags, the names (home, about us, products, services, contacts) inside. These list items would be displayed inline-block with a list-style-type of none. The text color is #EAD7A8, with a font-family of "Changa One", cursive. On hover, the text color changes to #884F16 with a background color of #EAD7A8 and a border-radius of approximately 10px.</p>

            <h3>The Call to Action:</h3>
            <p>This is the website's Call to Action. The CTA is used to instantly inform the user of the intent of the website. The CTA will typically include an action button which inclines the user to do something, most commonly purchase a product or service. Usually the CTA is the largest and one of the first elements on the page.</p><br>
            <p>On this particular website, the call to action is being used to show the user the services that this website provides. The two buttons represent the two services that the website wants the user to buy into: hiring enquiries (to help the user purchase their products) and the gallery of their products (to entice the customer into a possible purchase).</p>
            <h3>How to Build This:</h3>
            <p>This CTA would be built by using a container div with a background image. This particular CTA has a H1 heading, followed by an italic paragraph. It also contains two button elements (or possibly stylized a tags) of equal size that, when clicked upon, will take the user to a separate part of the website appropriate to the text on the button.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>The Page Features:</h3>
            <p>These are the features of this website. Features are typically shown in groups of three or four, and are part of the "feature, search, browse" concept. These are the items that the website feels are important and wants you to view. They may be items that are for sale, news articles, or other pertinent information.</p><br>
            <p>On this particular website, the page's features revolve around people. Since this was a sample website, the lorem ipsum text is used as a placeholder rather than actual information. However, page features in styles such as this one are often used to show how happy a customer is with a business, or how personable the business may be.</p>
            <h3>How to Build This:</h3>
            <p>These page features are floated article elements. They contain an image element followed by some type of heading, probably H2 or below. Beneath that heading is a paragraph, followed by a button element or stylized a tag. These articles are floated next to each other and are likely in their own section in order to allow whatever content beneath them to be cleared of the float.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>The Feedback Section:</h3>
            <p>This is the website's Feedback Section. The Feedback section is a form used to allow users to review the website and have their compliments, complaints, and concerns be heard by those in a position of power. Feedback sections may also be used to get into contact with a particular company, but their main intent is to get customer feedback in order to improve the website, improve the company services, and post reviews in order to entice new customers.</p>
            <h3>How to Build This:</h3>
            <p>This feedback section is entirely a form with a header, likely an H2. The form contains three text inputs, all floated next to each other, as well as a textbox input cleared and placed beneath. Each of these form elements contain a placeholder to describe what information should be placed in each box. The button underneath is either a button element or a stylized a tag which, when clicked, submits the form.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>The Contact Information:</h3>
            <p>This is the website's Contact Information. The contact information is used to allow consumers to get in contact with the business for any inquiries that they may have. Contact information generally includes an address, a phone number, an email address, and the link to any social media websites that the company may partake in. This is important for businesses to have as consumers deserve to have the possibility to contact the business if they have trouble with their product or if they want to enquire about a service.</p>
            <h3>How to Build This:</h3>
            <p>This contact information is a simple section element that contains two H2 elements (the Store Information text as well as the phone number) and several paragraphs. Some of the font is stylized and the email is using an a tag in order to, when clicked upon, open up the user's email application with a new message to be sent to that email. The buttons underneath are each an individual a tag with an image tag inside, depicting the social media accounts of this particular business to allow the user to find them in other, possibly more convenient, ways.</p>
